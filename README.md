# Talach Website

This is the source code for [talach.net](https://talach.net), a personal website where I experiment with generative art and screen printing. The website showcases various digital experiments that sometimes find their way onto fabric through screen printing techniques.

The site serves as a digital playground and portfolio, bridging the gap between digital art and physical prints.
